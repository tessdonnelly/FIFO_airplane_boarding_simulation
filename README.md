# FIFO Airplane Boarding Simulation

I wrote this code in 2013 for my senior design project. I was on a team of 4 systems engineers, but as the only person with a computer science minor, I took ownership of the code development.   
I first wrote a model in Matlab and then built a more robust simulation in Java with object-oriented classes.     

This code simulates an airplane boarding process and allowed us to test different boarding methods (or processes).  
The code takes an input of boarding method (ex. back to front), generates a large number of simulations of humans boarding an airplane, and outputs an average time for that boarding method.  
We included factors that usually slow down the process such as family groups boarding together and stowing carryon luggage.   
I also created a visualization tool to show one instance of boarding method for demonstration purposes.   

The code is no longer runnable in its current form as some Java APIs are now deprecated (ex. JApplet).   
I hope to revisit this one day and get it working again!
